I have tried to write the codes in **_python_** language whereas the course taught the languages in _C,C++and Java_.

I will make specific folders for the 2 languages i am fluent in i.e. **JAVA** and **PYTHON** and put the codes in it.

Contents:-

    1. Finding the number of digits in a number.

    3. Foctorila of a number
    4. Trailing numbers of seros in a factorial
    5. GCD of a number
    6. LCM of a number
    7. Palindrome in Strings using recursion {Method 1 - in python} {Method 2 in JAVA}
