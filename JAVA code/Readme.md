| Question | Procedure |
|-----|-----|
| Palindrome | I used the procedure of dividing the number by 10 and the remainder is the reversed didgit and then checked if the digit are the same|
| Factorial | I used two methods one _recuresive_ and another _iterative_ - in recursive the base case is when n = 0 then **return 0;** |
