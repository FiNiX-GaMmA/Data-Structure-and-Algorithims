# All the codes witten here are in **_PYTHON_**

| Question | Procedure | Time complexity |
|-----|-----|----|
| Palindrome | I used the procedure of dividing the number by 10 and the remainder is the reversed didgit and then checked if the digit are the same|O(n)
| Factorial | I used two methods one _recursive_ and another _iterative_ - in recursive the base case is when n = 0 then **return 0** | Recursive => T(n) = T(n)+O(n) for Iterative => O(n)
